"""Per-run LLM call control (the Lab 3 loop guard, adapted to evaluation runs).

Wiring for one run, outermost first:
    RunCounter → Caching → Budgeted(max_calls) → CircuitBreaker → Retrying → Gate → Paced → Gemini
Cache hits never reach the budget, so a re-run of a cached evaluation costs 0 and never
stops early; real calls stop at `max_calls` with BudgetExceeded."""
