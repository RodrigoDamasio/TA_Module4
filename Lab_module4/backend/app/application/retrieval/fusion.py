"""Weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion: merge ranked lists by rank, not score.

Vector similarities (0..1) and BM25 scores (unbounded) live on different scales; RRF
(Cormack et al. 2009) needs no normalization. Each list has a weight — the course's
hybrid search (§3.3) uses 0.7 for vectors and 0.3 for BM25. A document missing from a
list contributes nothing for it."""
